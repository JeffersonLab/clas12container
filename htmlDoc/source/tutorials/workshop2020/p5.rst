==================================
CLAS12 Workshop April 2020 - *4/5*
==================================


As the final step in this tutorial, let's use the docker libraries to compile a custom version of the clas12tag 4.3.2.
Let's go to the gemc source:

.. code-block:: ruby

 cd $GEMC
 pwd

This shows you that you are indded using the 4.3.2 version of clas12tags.

|br|

Let's modify gemc.cc so the version used will be "4.3.2.mine" (use any string you want) and recompile.

.. code-block:: ruby

 nano -c gemc.cc
 scons -j4 OPT=1


The -j4 means that you will use 4 cores to speed up the compilation. If you have more cores you should increase this number.

|br|

To verify that your changes have been implememted run the "./gemc" executable, you should see your version in the screen log.

.. code-block:: ruby

 ./gemc -USE_GUI=0
